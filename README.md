# N-Queen Problem solver

A mess of an implementation of A\* and Genetic Algorithm to solve the N-Queen problem.
Especially The UI and its implementation is an absolute mess, since i've done in like less than an hour. But hey, it was fun though.

# Usage

Install the venv:

```
pip install -r reqs.txt
```

and run **main.py**.

_Esc_ gets you to the previous screen, _Space_ pauses the A\*.
